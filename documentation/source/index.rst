This library provides anaphoric macros for Dylan, but what's an anaphoric macro?

From `Wikipedia
<https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anaphoric_macro&oldid=1066643579>`_:

An anaphoric macro is a type of programming macro that deliberately
captures some form supplied to the macro which may be referred to by
an anaphor (an expression referring to another). Anaphoric macros
first appeared in Paul Graham's `On Lisp
<https://web.archive.org/web/20120426001111/http://dunsmor.com/lisp/onlisp/onlisp_18.html>`_
and their name is a reference to linguistic anaphora — the use of
words as a substitute for preceding words.
